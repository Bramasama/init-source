      <h2>1. Our Role</h2>
      <p>
        Init Source Ltd is a UK-registered recruitment company specialising exclusively in Platform, SRE, and DevOps permanent recruitment.
        We operate in accordance with the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Fees</h2>
      <p>
        Permanent placement fees are calculated as a percentage of the Candidate's first-year total remuneration
        (base salary plus guaranteed bonuses, if applicable).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>15% - volume or new-client roles</li>
        <li>18-20% - specialist or senior hires</li>
        <li>Invoices are payable within 14 days of the Candidate's start date</li>
        <li>All fees are exclusive of VAT, where applicable</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Guarantee</h2>

        If a placed Candidate leaves within:

      <ul>
        <li>12 weeks of start date</li>
        <li>8 weeks for entry-level roles</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and the invoice has been paid in full and on time, Init Source Ltd will, at its discretion, either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a free replacement search for the same role; or</li>
        <li>Issue a full refund of the introduction fee.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The guarantee does not apply where the departure results from redundancy, role changes, misconduct, or unsuitable working conditions.
      </p>

        <li>Conduct all required right-to-work and suitability checks prior to employment</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        Candidate information is confidential and must not be disclosed to third parties.
        If an introduced Candidate is hired within 12 months of introduction, a full fee becomes payable.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Liability</h2>
