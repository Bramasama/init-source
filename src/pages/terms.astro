        <li>Issue a full refund of the introduction fee.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The guarantee is void if the departure results from redundancy, misconduct, role changes, or poor working conditions.

        Hiring an introduced Candidate within 12 months of introduction incurs a full fee.
